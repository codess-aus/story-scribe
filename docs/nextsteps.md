Here's the next escalation path now that Flex plan rejects content settings and 403 persists:

Immediate actions taken:

Removed forbidden WEBSITE_CONTENT* settings (Flex Consumption disallows them).
Simplified zip deploy to standard az functionapp deployment source config-zip.
Kept only essential AzureWebJobsStorage plus your app settings.
Added a snapshot step to confirm AzureWebJobsStorage is present.
Manual checks you should perform in Azure Portal (high-impact):

Storage account storyscribestorage:
Configuration: Confirm “Allow storage account key access” is Enabled.
Data protection / Advanced security: Ensure no immutability or policy blocking writes.
Networking: If not “Allow all networks”, temporarily set to all or add Function App outbound IPs (find under Function App → Properties).
Confirm it is NOT hierarchical namespace (ADLS v2 with HNS) — if HNS is enabled, create a new standard storage account for the Function App.
Function App:
Plan: Verify it’s “Flex Consumption”. Flex relies on internal content store; zip deploy still uses the storage account for package ingestion.
Identity: System-assigned identity does not matter with key-based connection but ensure no conflicting identity-only storage setup remains.
App Settings: Only one AzureWebJobsStorage; no lingering AzureWebJobsStorage__*.
Role assignments: Ensure no deny assignment on the storage account (rare but possible).
If after re-run it still fails with 403, choose a fallback route:

Fallback Option A (recommended quickest):

Create a NEW storage account (e.g. storyscribestoreflex) in same region.
Manually set AzureWebJobsStorage in the Function App to the new account’s connection string.
Re-run workflow (edit secret or let workflow fetch via CLI after you adjust code to target new account name).
Fallback Option B:

Redeploy backend as App Service (use backend FastAPI) instead of Functions. I can add a conditional job to deploy to storyscribe-web while Function issues are investigated.
Fallback Option C:

Convert Function to Container-based deployment (build image, push to ACR, configure Function App to use custom container). More effort.
Fallback Option D:

Delete and recreate Function App with a fresh storage account, then re-run pipeline.
